**Features:**  

**Simulation:** Simulates movement of vehicles from Chennai to different cities.   
**Path Visualization:** Visualizes vehicle paths and toll zones on an interactive map using Folium.   
**Toll Calculation:** Calculates toll charges dynamically based on distance traveled and congestion levels.   
**Graphical Interface:** Provides a graphical dashboard using Tkinter to display vehicle balances, toll charges, and a summary table.   

**Requirements:**  
Python 3.x   
**Libraries:** folium, matplotlib, tkinter
