**GPS Toll Based System Simulation**

This project simulates multiple vehicles traveling from Chennai to various destinations, tracking their paths, toll zone crossings, and calculating dynamic toll charges based on congestion levels.

**Features:**

**Simulation:** Simulates movement of vehicles from Chennai to different cities.
**Path Visualization:** Visualizes vehicle paths and toll zones on an interactive map using Folium.
**Toll Calculation:** Calculates toll charges dynamically based on distance traveled and congestion levels.
**Graphical Interface:** Provides a graphical dashboard using Tkinter to display vehicle balances, toll charges, and a summary table.

**Requirements:**
Python 3.x
**Libraries:** folium, matplotlib, tkinter
